# Mandelbrot-Set

This is a Python application that lets you render the Mandelbrot Set. I implemented the GUI with <i>Kivy</i> as well as <i>PIL</i> (<i>Python Imaging Library</i>). 
To increase performance, I used the <i>Numba</i> library which translates a part of my <i>Python</i> code into fast <i>machine code</i>.
